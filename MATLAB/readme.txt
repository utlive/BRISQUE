========================================================================

This is a demonstration of the Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE) index.
The algorithm is described in:

A. Mittal, A. K. Moorthy and A. C. Bovik, "No Reference Image Quality Assessment in the Spatial Domain"


You can change this program as you like and use it anywhere, but please
refer to its original source (cite our paper and our web page at
http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/quality/BRISQUE_release.zip).

========================================================================

Running on Matlab 


Input : A test image loaded in an array

Output: A quality score of the image. The score typically has a value
           between 0 and 100 (0 represents the best quality, 100 the worst).
  
Usage:

1. Load the image, for example

  image         = imread('testimage1.bmp'); 

2. Call this function to calculate the quality score:

   qualityscore = brisquescore(image)

Dependencies: 

Binaries: svm-predict, svm-scale (from LibSVM) - provided with release
MATLAB files: brisquescore.m, estimateggdparam.m, estimateaggdparam.m, brisque_feature.m (provided with release)

Data files: range_all, model_all (provided with release)

Image Files: testimage1.bmp, testimage2.bmp

NOTE: Please rename the .exe1 files to .exe files -- this code will work only on WINDOWS systems.

========================================================================

Note on training: 
This release version of BRISQUE was trained on the entire LIVE database.


This program uses LibSVM binaries.
Below is the requried copyright notice for the binaries distributed with this release.

====================================================================
LibSVM tools: svm-predict, svm-scale (binaries)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to run this on a Linux distribution, you could change the lines 

system('svm-scale -r allrange test_ind >> test_ind_scaled');
system('svm-predict -b 1 test_ind_scaled allmodel output >>dump');

to 

system('wine svm-scale -r allrange test_ind >> test_ind_scaled');
system('wine svm-predict -b 1 test_ind_scaled allmodel output >>dump');

Ofcourse, this now requires "wine" to be installed.
